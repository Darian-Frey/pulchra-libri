To control Arrakis is to control all. And it is across its vast expanses and in its arid caves that Frank Herbert’s epic adventure of political subterfuge and messianic deliverance is played out, a story that has become the best-selling science-fiction novel of all time, and is considered by many to be the genre’ greatest work.",

Celebrated artist Sam Weber was commissioned to illustrate the work – a labour of love that took the best part of a year to complete and four colour illustrations in each volume, two of which are double-page spreads, twelve original black-and-white illustrations and binding designs, for each of the four books that comprise this epic story, which form the front and back bindings of this two-volume edition.\nThe two-colour text includes decorative chapter initials based on an ancient script adapted by Weber to incorporate symbolic references to the story; a fitting tribute to a literary legacy that will stun generations to come.",

Fate has given Annie a chance to bring her favourite character back to life, and Paul won’t be leaving Annie’s remote farmstead alive until he complies. Misery sees Stephen King at the height of his writing powers in a novel that explores the psyche of an author suffering extreme torment.\nEdward Kinsella illustrated the best-selling Folio edition of The Shining and he again immerses himself in King’s narrative to create a terrifying and compelling set of illustrations, as well as a binding design that defines the novel: the antique Royal typewriter that is both Paul Sheldon’s entrapment and his only hope of liberty.",
